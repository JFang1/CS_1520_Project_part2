<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse" id="madLibQuote">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing of NOUN1 and praising NOUN2 was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great NOUN3 of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids NOUN1 itself, because it is NOUN1, but because those who do not know how to pursue NOUN1 rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain NOUN2 of itself, because it is NOUN2, but occasionally circumstances occur in which NOUN4 and NOUN2 can procure him some ADJECTIVE5 pleasure.</blockquote>
